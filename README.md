# Celonis Angular Signals Workshop

Welcome to the **Celonis Angular Signals Workshop**! ðŸŽ‰ In this workshop, weâ€™re diving into how signal help us to solve 
commons problems in Angular, exploring traditional approaches and then introducing **Signals** as a modern, reactive alternative. If youâ€™ve encountered `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked` errors or struggled with managing complex state across components, youâ€™re in the right place.

This workshop is ideal for beginners and intermediate Angular developers using **Angular 18.2**. Weâ€™ll cover topics like , why is not change or ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked and how Signals can make Angular applications cleaner and more efficient.

## Project Overview

The project is structured in `src/app` with the following main folders:

- **services**: Contains files like `users.service.ts` for managing API communication and business logic.
- **user**: Contains user-related components, such as `user.component.ts`.
- **utils**: Shared utilities and helper functions located in `utils.ts`.

Our main component, `app.component`, will be the focal point where we experiment with Change Detection, reactivity, and Signals.

## Workshop Flow

This workshop is divided into branches, each covering a specific part of our journey:

1. **Problem Branches**: Start with `workshop-01-problem` and `workshop-02-problem` to see how Change Detection issues arise in Angular and why they can be challenging.
2. **Solution Branches**: In `workshop-01-solution` and `workshop-02-solution`, weâ€™ll apply traditional techniques to address these issues.
3. **Signals Branches**: Finally, explore `workshop-01-solution-signals` and `workshop-02-solution-signals` to refactor with **Signals**, **Computed**, **Effect**, and **Model**, transforming how we handle state and reactivity.

### Topics Covered

Throughout the workshop, weâ€™ll cover essential concepts including:
- **Reactivity** in Angular and its limitations with complex state.
- **Change Detection**: Understanding Angularâ€™s default strategy and challenges.
- **OnPush Strategy**: How to use it for better performance and control over updates.
- **ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked**: Why this error happens and how to prevent it.
- **Signals**: Using Signals for cleaner, reactive state management.
- **Signal Model**: Organizing state in a way that simplifies component interactions.
- **Computed**: Creating derived state without complex bindings.
- **Effect**: Managing side effects reactively without relying heavily on lifecycle hooks.
... and more

Following the branches in order will help you understand the transition from traditional methods to a more reactive, Signal-based approach.
